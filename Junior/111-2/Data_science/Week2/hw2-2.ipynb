    "Trung is bored with his mathematics homeworks. He takes a piece of chalk and starts writing a sequence of consecutive integers starting with 1 to N (1 < N < 10000). After that, he counts the number of times each digit (0 to 9) appears in the sequence. For example, with N = 13, the sequence is: 12345678910111213 In this sequence, 0 appears once, 1 appears 6 times, 2 appears 2 times, 3 appears 3 times, and each digit from 4 to 9 appears once. After playing for a while, Trung gets bored again. He now wants to write a program to do this for him. Your task is to help him with writing this program. \n",
